    <h1>Bryan Valencia</h1>
    It ain't hard to tell, I excel then prevail
    The mic is contacted, I attract client√®le
    My mic check is life or death, breathin' a sniper's breath
    I exhale the yellow smoke of Buddha
    Through righteous steps

    Deep like 'The Shining', sparkle like a diamond
    Sneak a Uzi on the island, in my army jacket linin'
    Hit the Earth like a comet, invasion
    Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian, half-man, half-amazin'

    'Cause in my physical, I can express through song
    Delete stress like Motrin, then extend strong
    I drank Moet with Medusa, give her shotguns in Hell
    From the spliff that I lift an' inhale
    It ain't hard to tell

    The Buddha monk's in your trunk, turn the bass up
    Not stories by Aesop, place your loot up
    Parties, I shoot up
    Nas, I analyze, drop a jewel, inhale from the L
    School a fool, well, you feel it like Braille
    <h2>Books that changed my perspective</h2>
