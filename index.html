    <h1>Bryan Valencia</h1>
    
    Hi, I'm Bryan Valencia, also known as <i>DJFukYoLife</i>,
    a Mexican-American computer programmer based in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago">Chicago</a>.
    I was born on March 7th, 1977 in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tepalcatepec">Tepalcatepec, Michoacán</a>.<br>
    I spend most of my professional time writing code and hating my life. In that order.

    <img src="DJFukYoLife.jpg" width="50%" alt="Bryan Valencia DJFukYoLife"><br><br>
    It ain't hard to tell, I excel then prevail<br>     
    The mic is contacted, I attract clientèle<br>       
    My mic check is life or death, breathin' a sniper's breath<br>      
    I exhale the yellow smoke of Buddha<br>     
    Through righteous steps<br>     
    <br>        
    Deep like 'The Shining', sparkle like a diamond<br>     
    Sneak a Uzi on the island, in my army jacket linin'<br>     
    Hit the Earth like a comet, invasion<br>        
    Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian, half-man, half-amazin'<br>       
    <br>        
    'Cause in my physical, I can express through song<br>       
    Delete stress like Motrin, then extend strong<br>       
    I drank Moet with Medusa, give her shotguns in Hell<br>     
    From the spliff that I lift an' inhale<br>      
    It ain't hard to tell<br>             
    <h2>Books that changed my perspective</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The Phoenix Project</li>
        <li>The Unicorn Project</li>
        <li>The Richest Man in Babylon</li>
    </ul>

    

    <h2>Fundamental things I believe about society and life</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Most people are living their life on auto-pilot.
    <li>Life is too short to work like crazy for most of its part.
    <li>Arts are one of the few things worth life's best efforts. Programming is art, if done in certain ways.
    </ul>
