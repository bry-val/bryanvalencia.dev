    <h1>Bryan Valencia</h1>
    
    Hi, I'm Bryan Valencia, also known as <i>DJFukYoLife</i>,
    a Mexican American computer programmer based in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago">Chicago</a>.
    I was born on March 7h, 1977 in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campobello_di_Licata">Campobello di Licata</a>.<br>
    I spend most of my professional time writing code and hating my life. In that order.

    It ain't hard to tell, I excel then prevail<br>     
    The mic is contacted, I attract client√®le<br>       
    My mic check is life or death, breathin' a sniper's breath<br>      
    I exhale the yellow smoke of Buddha<br>     
    Through righteous steps<br>     
    <br>        
    Deep like 'The Shining', sparkle like a diamond<br>     
    Sneak a Uzi on the island, in my army jacket linin'<br>     
    Hit the Earth like a comet, invasion<br>        
    Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian, half-man, half-amazin'<br>       
    <br>        
    'Cause in my physical, I can express through song<br>       
    Delete stress like Motrin, then extend strong<br>       
    I drank Moet with Medusa, give her shotguns in Hell<br>     
    From the spliff that I lift an' inhale<br>      
    It ain't hard to tell<br>       
    <br>        
    The Buddha monk's in your trunk, turn the bass up<br>       
    Not stories by Aesop, place your loot up<br>        
    Parties, I shoot up<br>     
    Nas, I analyze, drop a jewel, inhale from the L<br>     
    School a fool, well, you feel it like Braille<br>
